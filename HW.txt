created an instance
created volume and snapshots
created VPC normally
created subnet mask also for the vpc
converted snapshot into volumes and then attached


Doubts:
need clarity on subnet mask creating
attached an existing volume to the new instance, but the configuration done is not visible in the attached instance


Topics left:
Autoscaling
ElasticIP
IAM
CloudWatch
CloudTrail
Elastic Bean stack

git
Manual VPC
